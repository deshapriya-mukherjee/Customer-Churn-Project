# Customer-Churn-Project-
Customer Churn Project with Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model
A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you’re an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.

### About dataset
1. Here we use a telecommunications data for predicting customer churn. 
2. This is a historical customer data where each row represents one customer. 
3. Typically this data is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company. 

This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. We can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.


The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
